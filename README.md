# plagrism_checker_ai


This project is an AI-based plagiarism detection tool that uses machine learning to detect paraphrased content. The model is built using Python and implemented in Jupyter Notebook. It utilizes a Kaggle dataset containing text data to train and evaluate the performance of the plagiarism detection system.

## Features

- **Plagiarism Detection**: Identifies similarities and paraphrased content in text data.
- **AI Model**: Uses machine learning algorithms to detect both exact matches and paraphrased content.
- **CSV Dataset**: The model is trained on a Kaggle dataset with text samples.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: The project is implemented in Jupyter Notebook for easy exploration and visualization.
